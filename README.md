# Blackjack
Play a hand against the dealer. The goal is to score 21, or as close to without going over. 21 is a Blackjack, and an automatic win. Each player is delt 2 cards to start, they have the option to HIT for one more card at a time to try and score 21 points, or STAY when they have enough points.
